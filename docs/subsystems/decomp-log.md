# Decompilation log

Append M0 mechanical translation, hybrid milestone, and bulk recovery progress
here. Ghidra-derived function bodies remain only under ignored `local/`.

- M0 baseline, 2026-11-06: `ghidra_to_c.py --skip-recovered --compile` examined
  1,022 unrecovered functions. 287 generated (66,726 bytes), 735 manual
  (477,703 bytes), 0/287 compiled (0 bytes). All first errors came from five
  stack inputs such as `[ESP+4]` being emitted as invalid C parameter names in
  the shared ABI header. The Nix dev shell could not start because access to
  `/nix/var/nix/daemon-socket/socket` was denied; the pinned OpenWatcom
  compiler was run directly.
- M0 rule 1, stack arguments, 2026-11-06: stack inputs now use valid local
  parameter names and are omitted from the register `#pragma aux` list. The
  rerun advanced past the shared-header stack-name errors, but remains 0/287
  (0/66,726 bytes): the next shared-header error is unsupported `float10` at
  generated ABI declaration `0x00028b80`.
- M0 rule 2, `float10`, 2026-11-06: Ghidra `float10` now maps to OpenWatcom
  `long double`, preserving the x87 extended type. The rerun advanced past
  that declaration; the report remains 0/287 (0/66,726 bytes), now blocked by
  the unconverted Ghidra `dword` type at `0x000b3084`.
- M0 rule 3, `dword`, 2026-11-06: Ghidra `dword` now maps to `uint32_t`. The
  rerun advanced past the dword declarations; the report remains 0/287
  (0/66,726 bytes), now blocked by Ghidra's generic function type `code` at
  `0x000ed133`.
